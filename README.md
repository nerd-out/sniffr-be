# sniffr-be
The backend of sniffr! an application for finding play dates for your dog!

#  Project Stack
A python flask app, which is dockerizerd

# Want to run this in developlment?
## First-Time Setup
1. Clone the backend repo to a folder on your machine.  
![clone this repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/main/extra/readme_images/clone_repo.png)  

2. Move into the cloned repo with: 
```bash
cd sniffr-be
```

3. If you are going to be changing code then switch to a new branch using:
```
git checkout xxxx
```

4. Add a blank file called `.env` into the repo so the app can pull sensitive information. Fill the `.env` file with the information from the .env pinned message in our discord.  
![env file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/main/extra/readme_images/env_directory.png)  

5. Set up a virtual environment (a mini python development workspace) using *pipenv* by running `pipenv install` when in the app's base directory:  
üö® *This step will produce more code than just shown below and could take a few minutes depending on dependancy installation / your machine.*

6. Activate your environment by running `pipenv shell` as the prompt says. This will load the things you placed in .env and activate the necessary python imports.

7. We need to set up the database next. You are going to run three commands in sequence into your bash terminal once you have started your pipenv shell in step 6:

    ```
        flask db init  
        flask db migrate  
        flask db upgrade  
    ```

    The above commands will set up the **init**ial sqlite db, create a **migrat**ion script that will set up the db as we have written it in `models.py`, and the third command will run the migration script (`2`) and **upgrade** (`3`) our initial (`1`) sqlite database. 

    üíª *You should end up with a folder called `migrations/` and the file `sniffrdb.db`, which contains our blank tables, if everything went well.* 

8. Lastly, we need to seed our database with starter information. To do so, run `python seed_db.py` when in the base directory to activate the seed script. If successful, it should print out new entries in each of the tables that were seeded. Example:  
![seed db output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/main/extra/readme_images/seed_db.png)

## Running the app (after the first-time installation steps above)
Supposing you did steps 1-8 above already...

1. Make sure you are in the correct branch!

2. Then activate your pipenv shell:  
    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ``` 
    ![pipenv shell 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/main/extra/readme_images/pipenv_shell.png) 

3. Once active, you can run the flask app:  
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    ![flask run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/main/extra/readme_images/flask_run.png) 

    ‚úîÔ∏è *This should run up the app. You can view the exact url and port you need in the output.  And now you can now use* curl *,* postman *,* thunder client *, or* a browser *to access routes*

### üí° Hint: Did you make changes to `models.py`??
If you made changes to `models.py` during development... you do not need to completely remake the database. Instead, you can **migrate** and **upgrade** the database (usually).  Try running:
    ```
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade
    ```
If successful, then you should be able to seed and use the new database tables/columns. If not, you may need to remake it from scratch after deleting the `sniffrdb.db` file and `migrations` folder.
