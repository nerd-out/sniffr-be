# sniffr-be
The backend of sniffr! an application for finding play dates for your dog!

#  Project Stack
A python flask app, which is dockerizerd

# Want to run this in developlment?
## First-Time Setup
1. Clone the backend repo to a folder on your machine  
![clone this repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/finish-user-login-routes/extra/readme_images/clone_repo.png)  

2. If you are going to be changing code then switch to a new branch using
```
git checkout xxxx
```
3. Move into the cloned repo with 
```bash
cd sniffr-be
```

4. Add a blank file called `.env` into the repo so the app can pull sensitive information. Fill the `.env` file with the information in the discord pinned messages.  
![env file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/finish-user-login-routes/extra/readme_images/env_directory.png)  

5. Set up a virtual environment (a mini python development workspace) using `pipenv` by running `pipenv install` when in the app's base directory:  
üö® *This step will produce more code than just shown below and could take a few minutes depending on dependancy installation / your machine.*  
![pipenv install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/finish-user-login-routes/extra/readme_images/pipenv_install.png) 

6. Activate your environment by running `pipenv shell` as the prompt says. This will load the things you placed in .env and activate the necessary python imports.

7. We need to set up the database next. You are going to run 3 commands in sequence into your bash terminal once you have started your pipenv shell in step 6:

    i. `flask db init`  
    ii. `flask db migrate`  
    iii. `flask db upgrade`  

    The above commands will set up the **init**ial sqlite db, create a **migrat***tion script that will set up the db as we have written it in `models.py` and the third command will run the migration script (`ii`) and **upgrade** (`iii`) our initial (`i`) sqlite database. 

    üíª *You should end up with a folder called `migrations/` and the file `sniffrdb.db`, which contains our blank tables, if everything went well.* 

8. Lastly, we need to seed our database with starter information. To do so, run `python seed_db.py` when in the base directory to run the seed script. If successful, it should print out new entries in each of the tables that were seeded. Example:  
![seed db output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/finish-user-login-routes/extra/readme_images/seed_db.png)

## Running the app (after the first-time installation steps above)
Supposing you did steps 1-8 above already...

1. Make sure you are in the correct branch, and then activate your pipenv shell:  
    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ``` 
    ![pipenv shell 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/finish-user-login-routes/extra/readme_images/pipenv_shell.png) 

2. Once active, you can run the flask app:  
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    ![flask run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-best-team-seven/sniffr-be/finish-user-login-routes/extra/readme_images/flask_run.png) 

    ‚úîÔ∏è *This should run up the app. You can now use* curl *,* postman *,* thunder client *, or* a browser *to access routes*

# DOCKER -- UNDER CONSTRUCTION
If you want to quickly run a docker container of this app then you can:
1. Download the repo
2. Run `docker-compose up --build`
## Docker Container Usage
1. docker start sniffr-be...
2. docker stop sniffr-be...
